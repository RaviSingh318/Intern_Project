# Simple Form Validation (HTML + CSS + JS) & Python Input Script

## 📌 What I Built

This project consists of two parts:

1. **Frontend Form (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)**  
   A basic web form with:
   - Name and Email input fields  
   - Submit button  
   - JavaScript validation that checks:
     - Both fields are filled
     - Email contains '@'
   - Shows success/error alerts based on the input

2. **Python Script**  
   A simple CLI-based script that:
   - Takes Name and Email as input
   - Prints the result in a formatted message

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Python 3.x
